### Rubymotion Auto layout example 
this is an example on how to use [auto layout](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/Articles/Introduction.html%23//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010853). this is an introduction to Constraints which represent  relationships between user interface elements such as “these views line up head to tail,” or “this button should move with this split view subview.

I'll be writting an "Rubymotion/MacRuby Auto Layout Guide" in the next few weeks.
