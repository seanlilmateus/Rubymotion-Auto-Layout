### Rubymotion Auto layout example 
this is an example on how to use [auto layout](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/Articles/Introduction.html%23//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010853). this is an introduction to Constraints which represent  relationships between user interface elements such as “these views line up head to tail,” or “this button should move with this split view subview.

I'll be writting an "Rubymotion/MacRuby Auto Layout Guide" in the next few weeks.

This example illustrates both NSLayoutConstraint creation form:
	- Create constraints described by an ASCII art-like visual format string
	- Create a constraint of the form
to test this, you can use either ALViewController#layout_subviews2 or ALViewController#layout_subviews in the ALViewController#viewDidLoad method.

have fun!!!
